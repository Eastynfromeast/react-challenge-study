# CSS Modules
    doesn't take any configuration
    global style? just put global.css on the root layout file
        import "../styles/global.css";
        put general styles for general tag without classes

    Option 1
        name.module.css
        import module.css file as if it is a js file!
        put only selective class styles == has to use class name
            Selector "ul" is not pure (pure selectors must contain at least one local class or id)


# Movie Styles


# Movie Trailers


# Dynamic Metadata
    you can create dynamic metadata for [id] pages by creating a function 
    /(movie)/movies/[id]/page.tsx
    
    export async function generateMetadata({ params: { id } }: IParams) {
        const movie = await getMovie(id);
        return {
            title: movie.title,
        };
    }

    calling API twice is not a bad idea for next.js ver.14
    since the request is cached

    params id is an object given to page component


#Deployment
    connet Vercel with your own github
    and push your local repo as a usual github push
    
    prefetch
        pre-fetch some data which can be opened later
        Movie.tsx
        <Link prefetch href={`/movies/${id}`}>
				{title}
        </Link>
