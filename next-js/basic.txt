# What is Next.JS
    best framework to build
    is incredibly good
    The web framework for when it matters

    ## is it a library or framework?
        React - a library
            something that you use within your code
            you are the one in control - architecture, session, etc...
            you make all the decisions
            library didn't make any decisions
            React JS is a library building UI interface
            You have all the freedom, you are the boss

        Next.JS - a framework
            something that uses your code == you are not in charge
            framework will automate many things for you 
                basically helps you
            you are not in control == you have to follow the rules of the framework
            you have to put a file in the right folder
            Next.JS will call your code
                the framework will execute your code
            => we have to learn the rules
                all we have to export sth in right shapes
