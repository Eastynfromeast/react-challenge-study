# state management
    Recoil - state management library for React JS

    What is state management?
        Dark mode <-> light mode

        isDark : App -> Coins -> Coin // bad hierachy
        what if we put props in bubble?! => recoil
    
        ## Recoil
        put a value in a "bubble"
        and give the bubble to the components which needs it
        bubble? is called ATOM
        
        1. Recoil creates different atoms
            it doesn't belongs to any component
        2. Connect the component directly to the atom
        ==> It is way better to manage your global state in a seperate place
