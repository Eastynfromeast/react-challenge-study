# Styles
    meyer.web reset css
    or npm i styled-reset

    Where is the perfect location to make whole documents' css reset?
    styled-component
        isolate a component style
        -> createGlobalStyle
            whole document style like fonts?
            will go to the head component and inject global style

    react fragment?

    Install font

    Where is the more acceptable place of ThemeProvider?

    How we can send the data between the screen behind the scenes
        use State!
        we can send state via Link
        in Coins.tsx 	
        <Link to={`/${coin.id}`} state={{ name: coin.name }}>

        in Coin.tsx
        const { state } = useLocation();
        	using state!
	()(); functions which hits immediately

	const info: {}
	Typescript will know info is alway empty -> we have to explain TS what everything is
		will use autoGenerate(?) in advanced level
	
	console.log(infoData);
	click right on mouse and save it as Store as global variable
	Object.keys(temp2).join(); // get keys 
	Object.values(temp1).map(v=> typeof v).join() // get type of values

	How you can explain to TS MANUALLY
		interface ITag {
			coin_counter: number;
			ico_counter: number;
			id: string;
			name: string;
		}
		inteface IInfoData{
			tag: ITag[];
		}
	
	no dependency [] - run only one time
		best practice of hook(useEffect) - should put something inside []
		coinId will never change, so the result will be same with no dependency

	? will protect us
		if it is null or undefined or not there, beyond data will not be required

	Nested router
        we use Outlet instead
    
    useMatch()
		const priceMatch = useMatch("/:coinId/price"); => null or object!
	
	react query
		we can delete useEffect that we wrote before thx to React Query
		QueryProvider

		fetcher function!
			Nico - basically all my api things let it be far away from components

    ueseQuery(uniqueId, fetcherFn)
	    useQuery hook calls fetchCoins
	    if fetcherFn is loading? react query will let you know isLoading
	    when the fetcherFn finishes, react query will set the return on data

        in api.ts

        react query doesn't destroy the data
            implementing cashe
            react query doesn't hit the api after the first time

        	Devtools
		<ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={true} />
	
	react query needs different key!
		react query looks query as an array -> ["info",coinId]

		why react query is cool?
			1. fetcher function 
			2. powerful cacheing machanism 
			3. ReactQueryDevtools

		how fetcher fn works
			- argument? makes it as an anonymous funcion and send the argument
			- keys : must be unique to be restored and used in cache system 
				creating an array ["idName",id]
			const {isLoading : changeLoadingName, data: changeDataName} = useQuery<interface>(id, fetcherFn);
