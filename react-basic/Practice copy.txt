 form - default event is submission

  we cannot directly modify state on React unlike JavaScript array.push()
    we never modify state directly!
    has to use modifier function setSth

  State to be always NEW
  let food = [1,2,3,4]
  food = [..food,6]

  two different options of use modifier function
    a. setToDo("") : put value
    b. setToDo(()=>{ }); :send a function 

  React JS makes you use JavaScript more 
    map() allows you to transform the items in array into new way
    Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
