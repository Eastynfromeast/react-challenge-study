# How Typescript Works
    your browser understand Typescript

    Typescript protects you from our stupidity
    (Javascript is sooooo unsafe)
    
    The protection happens "before" the code is turned into JS
        it lets you not to do stupid thing in Javascript
        BEFORE RUNTIME

# Implicit Types vs Explicit Types
    we don't have to specify what type the variable is in JS
    
    Typescript is going to "infer" your type for you
    Implicit way    
        let a = hello; // a is a string type
    
    Explicit == Specific way 
        let b: boolean = "x";
            (how we communicate with type-checker)

        let c = [1,2,3];
        c.push("hello"); // error!

        let c :number[] = [];
        c.push(1);
