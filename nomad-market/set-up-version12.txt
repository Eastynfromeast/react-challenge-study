# Next.JS Setup
    version
        alpha
        beta
        RC === Release Candidate

#Prisma
    is NextJS ORM 
    Object Relational Mapping
    Prisma allows you to talk to db
    create client
    going to use MySQL

    npx prisma init
    Next steps:
    1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
    2. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql, sqlite, sqlserver, mongodb or cockroachdb.
    3. Run prisma db pull to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema.
    4. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

    model User{
        id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
        name String
        phone Int? @unique
        email String? @unique
        avatar String?
        createdAt DateTime @default(now())
        updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
    }

    prisma will look your schema.prisma file for...
        1. push models to db and do your SQL migration for you
        2. create a client to talk to your db and add some sort of types autocomplete to your file

#PlanetScale
    The MySQL - compatible serverless database platform
    serverless? we don't need to manage server
    MySQL - compatible? using something a little bit different with MySQL
    Vitess - built at Google to scale YouTube.com
    Scalable. Reliable. MySQL-compatible. Cloud-native. Database.
        - scalability
        - manageability
        - shard management
        - performance
        - connection pooling
        - workflow

    fake database to deploy 
    you don't have to download MySQL

    how do we create a secure connection with PlanetScale
        pscale connect : secure connection 

    MySQL compatible ?
        little bit different with MySQL

    foreign key constrain?
        Users DB:
            id: 1 username:nico
        
        Comments DB:
            id: 1 text:wow! user:(Users DB:5)
            normal MySQL, PostgreSQL will have error
        
        Vitess is focus on the scalability
            they do not check if the user 5 exists or not
            => DB will not stop us when we using pscale
                Prisma will checking it 

    npx prisma db push
        Environment variables loaded from .env
        Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
        Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "postgres", schema "public" at "aws-0-ap-northeast-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432"

        Generated Prisma Client (v5.12.1) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 54ms

    ## Prisma Client
        Prisma modifies our database
        nice admin panel : prisma studio
            npx prisma studio

        /lib/client.ts
            npm i @prisma/client - not development dependency we are going to use it for real

            import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

            const client = new PrismaClient();

            client.user.create({
                data: {
                    email: "hi",
                    name: "hi",
                },
            });

        we should not be able to run PrismaClient on the browser!

        PostgreSQL
            PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database management system（ORDBMS） with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

            PostgreSQL supports a large part of the SQL standard and offers many modern features:
                complex queries
                foreign keys
                triggers
                updatable views
                transactional integrity
                multiversion concurrency control

            PostgreSQL can be extended by the user in many ways, for example by adding new
                data types
                functions
                operators
                aggregate functions
                index methods
                procedural languages
        
        npx prisma migrate dev
